1. Name of PA: PA6: Stack In C

2. Description of PA: In this PA, I am constructing the data structure called
stack using the programming language C. Stack follows a particular order in 
which the operations are performed ("Last In First Out" or 
"First In Last Out"). In addition, while creating the stack structure, I had
to consider the memory leaks and memory allocations using Valgrind because
elements are always being added or removed.

3. Features: In the Stack class, it has all the attributes on how to add
elements to a stack. It can check if its empty or full, see how many elements
are in the stack, what is the capacity, and add, remove, search, reverse
elements in a stack. It can also clear all elements in in the stack or clean
the stack itself.
